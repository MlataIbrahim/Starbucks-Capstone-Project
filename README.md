## Project Motivation <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>

- Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. 
An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free).
Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve in this project.
- we will combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.
This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product
whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.
- The problem statement I am aiming to answer are :<br/>
**(1)** Discover customer attributes as Age , income, gender.<br/>
  **(2)** Discover How long did the users become our members ? .<br/>
  **(3)** predict whether or not the offer will respond by the person.<br/>
Using the data provided (portfolio, profile, Transactional),I answer first and second question using charts
and i answer the third question using 6 classification models.
